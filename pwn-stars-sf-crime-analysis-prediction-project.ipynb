Today, the city is known more for its tech scene than its criminal past. \nFrom Sunset to SOMA, and Marina to Excelsior, this project analyzes 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods to create a model that predicts the category of crime that occurred, given time and location.  \n# Definition  \n## Project Overview  \nCrime is a social phenomenon as old as societies themselves, and although there will never be a free from crime society - just because it would need everyone in that society to think and act in the same way - societies always look for a way to minimize it and prevent it.\nIn the modern United States history, crime rates increased after World War II, peaking from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Violent crime nearly quadrupled between 1960 and its peak in 1991. Property crime more than doubled over the same period. Since the 1990s, however, crime in the United States has declined steadily.\nUntil recently crime prevention was studied based on strict behavioral and social methods, but the recent developments in Data Analysis have allowed a more quantitative approach in the subject. We will explore a dataset of nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods, and we will create a model that predicts the category of crime that occurred, given the time and location.  \n## Problem Statement\nTo examine the specific problem, we will apply a full Data Science life cycle composed of the following steps:\n1. Data Wrangling to audit the quality of the data and perform all the necessary actions to clean the dataset.\n2. Data Exploration for understanding the variables and create intuition on the data.\n3. Feature Engineering to create additional variables from the existing.\n4. Data Normalization and Data Transformation for preparing the dataset for the learning algorithms (if needed).\n5. Training / Testing data creation to evaluate the performance of our models and fine-tune their hyperparameters.\n6. Model selection and evaluation. This will be the final goal; creating a model that predicts the probability of each type of crime based on the location and the date.  \n\n## Metrics\nThe most appropriate evaluation metric for such problems is the **multi-class logarithmic loss**. Logarithmic loss measures the performance of a classification model where the prediction output is a probability value between 0 and 1. For each incident, we will predict a set of predicted probabilities (one for every class), and we will calculate the average deviation from the real values. \nTo get a little more intuition on the metric, for a specific incident:\n* We get 0 loss from the categories of crimes that did not happen (since yij =0 yijlog(pij)) no matter our predicted probability.\n* We get log(pij) loss from the category that happened, where pij is our predicted probability for the specific category.  \n\nWe have to note here that since all the probabilities for a specific incident sum to 1, each probability we predict for a category that did not happen creates an “indirect” loss since it decreases our predicted probability for the category of crime that happened.\nIn other words, the metric evaluates the certainty of our model for each category of crime/incident.  \n\n# Analysis  \n## Data Exploration  \nThe dataset is in a tabular form and includes chronological, geographical and text data and contains incidents derived from the SFPD Crime Incident Reporting system.

Although longitude does not contain any outliers, latitude includes some 90o values which correspond to the North Pole. \n## Exploratory Visualization\nBased on the Project’s statement, we need to predict the probability of each type of crime based on time and location.

Instead, Bayesian optimization, also called Sequential Model-Based Optimization (SMBO), implements this idea by building a probability model of the objective function that maps input values to a probability of a loss: p (loss | input values). The probability model, (also called the surrogate or response surface), is easier to optimize than the actual objective function. Bayesian methods select the next values to evaluate by applying a criterion (usually Expected Improvement) to the surrogate. The concept is to limit the evaluations of the objective function by spending more time choosing the next values to try.  \n\nTo conclude to the final model, we used five folds Cross-Validation for 100 epochs and early stopping with Bayesian Optimization. Also, we created a custom callback function so we can write proper logs that can be read by Tensorboard. This way we were able to monitor the validation process in real time.  \n\nThe above was up to some point an iterative process. We run the optimization process until we noticed in Tensorboard that the models converge. Then we stopped and evaluated the results and move to the next iteration. (example of the process [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yannisp/sf-crime-analysis-prediction-optimiz-ex)) \n\nFirst we optimized a few basic hyperparameters including:\n* `Boosting` selection between gbdt and dart\n* `Max_delta_step` uniformly in the range  [0, 2]\n* `Min_data_in_leaf` uniformly in the range [10,30]\n* `Num_leaves` uniformly in the range [20,40]  \n\nAfter the model converged, a second round of tuning followed:\n* `Boosting`: gbdt\n* `Max_delta_step` uniformly in the range  [0.5, 2.5]\n* `Min_data_in_leaf` uniformly in the range [10, 25]\n* `Num_leaves` uniformly in the range [20, 45]\n* `Max_bin` uniformly in the range [200, 500],\n* `Learning_rate` uniformly in the range [0.1, 2]\n\nFinally we concluded to the following hyperparameters:  \n* `Boosting`: gbdt\n* `Max_delta_step`: 0.9\n* `Min_data_in_leaf`:  21\n* `Num_leaves`: 41\n* `Max_bin`: 465,\n* `Learning_rate`: 0.4  \n\nIn the following figure, we present the performance of the best model from each step of optimization.  \n![](https://i.imgur.com/grRIpi5.png?1)\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"88d5f60166b3de09c089697e3fd02306a0990749"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Building the final model","metadata":{"_uuid":"4a94ee3d432d6bc02d8ab35f9007c3b682b9c5d9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading the data\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/san-francisco-crime-classification/train.csv', parse_dates=['Dates'])\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/san-francisco-crime-classification/test.csv', parse_dates=['Dates'], index_col='Id')\n\n# Data cleaning\ntrain.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)\ntrain.replace({'X': -120.5, 'Y': 90.0}, np.NaN, inplace=True)\ntest.replace({'X': -120.5, 'Y': 90.0}, np.NaN, inplace=True)\n\nimp = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')\n\nfor district in train['PdDistrict'].unique():\n    train.loc[train['PdDistrict'] == district, ['X', 'Y']] = imp.fit_transform(\n        train.loc[train['PdDistrict'] == district, ['X', 'Y']])\n    test.loc[test['PdDistrict'] == district, ['X', 'Y']] = imp.transform(\n        test.loc[test['PdDistrict'] == district, ['X', 'Y']])\ntrain_data = lgb.Dataset(\n    train, label=y, categorical_feature=['PdDistrict'], free_raw_data=False)\n\n# Feature Engineering\ntrain = feature_engineering(train)\ntrain.drop(columns=['Descript','Resolution'], inplace=True)\ntest = feature_engineering(test)\n\n# Encoding the Categorical Variables\nle1 = LabelEncoder()\ntrain['PdDistrict'] = le1.fit_transform(train['PdDistrict'])\ntest['PdDistrict'] = le1.transform(test['PdDistrict'])\n\nle2 = LabelEncoder()\nX = train.drop(columns=['Category'])\ny= le2.fit_transform(train['Category'])\n\n# Creating the model\ntrain_data = lgb.Dataset(\n    X, label=y, categorical_feature=['PdDistrict'])\n\nparams = {'boosting':'gbdt',\n          'objective':'multiclass',\n          'num_class':39,\n          'max_delta_step':0.9,\n          'min_data_in_leaf': 21,\n          'learning_rate': 0.4,\n          'max_bin': 465,\n          'num_leaves': 41\n         }\n\nbst = lgb.train(params, train_data, 100)\n\npredictions = bst.predict(test)\n\n# Submitting the results\nsubmission = pd.DataFrame(\n    predictions,\n    columns=le2.inverse_transform(np.linspace(0, 38, 39, dtype='int16')),\n    index=test.index)\nsubmission.to_csv(\n    'LGBM_final.csv', index_label='Id')","metadata":{"_uuid":"1b675ca8c60ee991f7121c31d067a76713b315e5","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-11T11:13:55.665516Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-11T11:13:55.665744Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-11T11:19:06.277966Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-11T11:13:55.665714Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-11T11:19:06.276783Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Model Evaluation and Validation\nThe final model scored 2.25697 on the training set which is 16% lower from the naive prediction (2.68015)  and 2% better than the benchmark.

For this reason, we had to be creative and use advanced techniques during the hyperparameter optimization to make a difference.  \nThis is a hard problem to solve with a heavily unbalanced dataset and the unpredictability (up to some point) of the “human factor”.  \n## Improvements\nWe are sure there is space for improvement. Two additional techniques we would like to implement if there was the necessary time would be:  \n\n* Create **ordinal representations** for the features that present a kind of cyclicity (Month, Weekday, Hour, Minute). The reasoning behind this is that if we take the Hour as an example, the default representation implies that 23 and 00 (midnight) are 23 “units” away although in reality, they are 1 “unit” apart. A way to solve it is to imagine the hour in a real clock and take their projections on the axes passing from the center of the clock. This way the distance between 23 and 00 is the same as between 00 and 01. We can achieve this with functions like Hx = sin(2\\*π\\*H/23) & Hy = cos(2\\*π\\*H/23) for the hour and accordingly for the rest.    \n\n* Use **embeddings** or any other text processing technique, for the addresses. By extracting if the incident has happened to a block or a crossroad we have extracted the minimum gain from this feature, and maybe there are some patterns to exploit and give us even better score.","metadata":{"_uuid":"b8d7d231cfb8eb22370a63719ccfa10fcc1dd26b"}}]}
